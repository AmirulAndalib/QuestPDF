Version 2024.6.1
- Layout debugging: significantly improved calculation performance and accuracy of issue detection.
- Text element: improved the default sizing behavior for the Text element. Now, when the text is empty, it works more consistently by taking up zero width while still reserving vertical space based on the font size.
- Fixed compatibility with .NET Standard 2.0.
- Fixed an issue causing invisibility of Table elements containing only Header/Footer elements without content.
- Improved the Document Composition Fluent API for Page, Table and Decoration elements. An exception is now thrown if any layer is configured more than once, preventing unexpected behavior.


Version 2024.6.2
- Reduced peak memory usage in documents with high number of text elements.
- Implemented a new caching mechanism to reduce the number of layout-related calculations.
- Introduced caching for DynamicSvgImage to enhance performance when the image is repeated across multiple pages.
- Introduced caching for DynamicImage to enhance performance when the image is repeated across multiple pages.
- Generating debugging information now respects the QuestPDF.Settings.EnableDebugging flag.
- Enhanced the accuracy and conciseness of layout-issue debugging messages.
- Fixed an issue where text width calculation was unnecessarily rounded, which caused text overflow.
- Resolved an issue where the Text element was not visible when it contained only the page number.


Version 2024.6.3
- Improved performance of Text elements containing null, empty, or whitespace content only.
