            <para>Although this adjustment modifies the space available to its inner content, some elements might use their own strategies to fill that space.</para>
            <para>For example, an Image with the <see cref="Infrastructure.ImageScaling.FitWidth" /> setting may retain its size, but its quality could vary based on the DPI setting.</para>
            <para>In contrast, text will not only appear smaller or bigger; but also a different number of words may fit each line.</para>

                The content direction affects various layout structures. In LTR mode, items are typically aligned to the left.
                This mode also influences the direction of items in certain layouts. For instance, in a row element with LTR mode,
                the first item is positioned on the left, while the last item is on the right.
